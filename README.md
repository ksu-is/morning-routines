# morning-routines
The python project makes it easier to choose your morning routine and/or bedtime routine. By randomizing tasks in either routine, users get a unique routine every time. Allowing the routine to have variety and not get too monotinous. This is great for users who are nuerodivergent or others who thrive on spontanity.
